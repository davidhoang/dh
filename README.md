# David Hoang
Hello. This is my personal repo that I'd like to open source with everyone. You'll find content here such as:
* Assets and copy I use for my personal website
* Speaking Resources
* A list of frameworks, processes, and writing

## My Design Principles
* __Set your personal bar high__. Don't expect you to be a unicorn, but try
* __Next executable step__. What’s the next executable step you can take to add value and make progress?
* __Design is not magic__. It’s a rigorous process of exploration, iteration, and validation until you reach your outcome; a process that makes the end user feel like it is magic.

I'm open to feedback and contributions on this. Please feel free to submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/davidhoang/dh/issues) or submit a pull request.
