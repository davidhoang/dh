# I'm David (DH)
_Last updated March 2, 2024_

Hello. My name is David, and I'm often referred to as DH. It's not a special nickname, mainly because there is always another David at companies I work. You can call me either, but never Dave (please).

I'm a designer, angel investor, and writer. This repo is public notes I'd like to share and open source to everyone. My ask is if you get something useful from this content to refer to it and provide attribution.

There are three core areas in this repo:
- [Resources](/resources): Content I've created that I feel comfortable calling my original work
- [Recommendations](recommendations): Resources and content created by other people that had a profound impact on me. Nothing linked in here is my original work
- [About Me](about-me): Links to things you can find out me, such as speaker bios, photos, etc
