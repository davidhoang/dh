# Workflow


## Email
I use [Andreas Klinger's](https://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more) awesome workflow for Gmail.

* has:yellow-bang OR has:red-bang == Awaiting Reply
* has:red-bang == Needs Action/Reply
* has:orange-guillemet == Delegated
* has:blue-info == Deferred

Some pointers:
* Sort order matters in the stars you use
* Make sure you have social and promotions disabled under the Inbox tab


## Folder Structure
I use the same folder structure for every project and app I use for consistency. This means Apple Notes, Notion, OmniFocus, and every app I use structures content the same way so I don't have to thinka bout how it is organized.

Root folders are in alphabetical order. After that it's slightly unorganized.

* Creative Projects
* David & Jessica (my partner)
* Inspiration 
* Personal
* Professional
 * Conferences & Speaking
* Travel
* Work - Current
 * General Assembly
 * Webflow
* Work - Previous
 * Black Pixel
 * One Medical
 * Etc.
