### Prototyping Framework
* Now: What is the current state of the product? What can we do within a sprint cycle or two to deliver value?
* Next: What is on the horizon? What information do we need to know and learn to inform the opportunity backlog?
* Future: What is the future state of our product and experience? Consider strategic elements that need to influence what we do now.
